By oldschool we mean 80s, Grey Brick style, but without the blur. "So what" you might say, seeing as everybody seems to be doing that right now. We don''t do gimmicks, physics engines, or flashy colourful graphics. Actually, we don''t do colours at all. Instead our focus is on gameplay. There are a lot of potentially good platform games out there that fail miserably due to badly thought through leveldesign, annoying gimmicks, or because the jump height of your character is just a few pixels off what you think it should be. So our biggest focus is on getting it just right. If you fail at UMG, you will know it is because you made a mistake, not because of the game not doing what you expected it to.');
