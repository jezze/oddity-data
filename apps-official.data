Enigma is simple to learn, challenging to play, but hard to master. Players of almost any age can enjoy it. It contains hundreds of levels. And if that isn''t enough, it''s also completely free. If you like puzzle games and have a steady hand, Enigma will probably keep you busy for hours on end.  ------------------------------------------------- IMPORTANT NOTE : ------------------------------------------------- Because of copyright laws, Enigma for the GCW Zero does not include the five official level-packs based on the original Oxyd game. Installing them yourself is easy, however. Run the game once so that it creates a folder in your home directory: $HOME/.enigma/ (Using FTP, this will be /home/.enigma/)  Download the latest Windows .ZIP binary release from here: Enigma downloads page  Extract it to a folder on your computer and, using FTP, copy the following five folders into your GCW Zero''s /home/.enigma/levels folder:  data/levels/enigma_esprit/ data/levels/enigma_oxyd/ data/levels/enigma_oxydextra/ data/levels/enigma_oxydmagnum/ data/levels/enigma_peroxyd/  NOTE: if using FTP, you want to be sure you have any option to show hidden folders turned ON, or else you won''t be able to see the /home/.enigma/ folder. Also, make sure BINARY TRANSFER MODE is turned on.  Your $HOME/.enigma/levels/ folder should now look something like this: auto/ cross/ enigma_esprit/ enigma_oxyd/ enigma_oxydextra/ enigma_oxydmagnum/ enigma_peroxyd/ externaldata/ legacy_dat/  Now, start up Enigma and you will now see the Oxyd levels under the "Deja-Vu" level-pack category.  BTW, if you ever create or download any additional levels, they should go into the auto/ folder shown above.  ------------------------------------------------- PLAYING THE ORIGINAL OXYD LEVELS: ------------------------------------------------- Enigma is able to read the original Oxyd family of games'' data files! If you own the original games, you can copy the .DAT level files into your $HOME/.enigma/levels/legacy_dat/ folder. The level sets will then show up in the "Dongleware" category.  ------------------------------------------------- MORE ABOUT THE GAME: ------------------------------------------------- The object of the game is to find and uncover pairs of identically colored ''Oxyd'' stones. Simple? Yes. Easy? Certainly not! Hidden traps, vast mazes, laser beams, and most of all, countless hairy puzzles usually block your direct way to the Oxyd stones. Enigma''s game objects (and there are hundreds of them, lest you get bored) interact in many unexpected ways, and since many of them follow the laws of physics (Enigma''s special laws of physics, that is), controlling them isn''t always trivial ...  The original goal of the Enigma project was to keep the spirit of the Oxyd game series alive, after its publisher decided to leave the gaming business in 2002. Fans of this famous game will experience deja-vu. However, over the years, Enigma has absorbed ideas from countless other popular games, and added its own unique twists to each of them.  To learn fully how to play the game, you are encouraged to read the excellent official user''s manual and also visit the official Enigma home page  ------------------------------------------------- PORT FEATURES:  ------------------------------------------------- The original game is meant to be played with a mouse. Because of this, I have taken pains to make it as playable as possible on our handheld gaming system that lacks a mouse. The marble can be controlled with either the Analog Stick, the DPAD, or the internal G-sensor. In order to play with the G-sensor you must first enable it in the game''s settings. Playing using the DPAD would be a bit like cheating, and I discourage you from doing so.   In addition to the default movement speed, you can move with three additional speeds: Speed #1 is mapped to the B button, Speed #2 to the X button, and Speed #3 to the Y button. You may change these speeds in the options menu, under "Controls", along with a few other options, like enabling or calibrating the G-sensor, or changing deadzones.  ------------------------------------------------- CONTROLS: ------------------------------------------------- There is a handy in-game list of the control mappings. Select "Help" from the main menu and then select "GCW Zero Controls".');

You must avoid bullet barrages and use your laser to destroy the enemy battleship. The closer you are, the more damage you cause. You get a new ship after 200,000 points and then every 500,000 points.  My GCW port is a highly-optimized OpenGLES conversion that runs at 100% full speed. It also features several new options the original game lacked: * Optionally rotated-and-zoomed playfield * Completely customizable control scheme * Trainer "cheat" modes (high-score saving is disabled when in use) * Laser can be turned on by default * Music and "bullet-time slowdown" can easily be disabled * Bullet-shape outlines can be turned on or off (good for 320x240 resolutions)  ------------------------------------------------- MODES OF PLAY: ------------------------------------------------- 1.) NORMAL MODE - This is the standard game mode. Your ship is slower when firing the laser. You have a limited number of bombs that clear enemy bullets.  2.) PSY MODE - This mode is inspired by the "Psyvariar" family of games. When your ship grazes a bullet, the gauge fills up. When the gauge is full, your ship becomes temporarily invincible. Use this short period of time to graze as many bullets as possible and become invincible again... This technique is also called ''scratching''. The ''special'' attack is used to "scratch" on a wider area, but it slows down your movement.   3.) IKA MODE - This mode is inspired by the legendary game "Ikaruga" for Dreamcast … Gamecube. Your ship can switch between red and blue colors. Your ship absorbs bullets of the same color but others destroy it. Absorbed bullets are automatically changed into lasers that damage the enemy.   4.) GW MODE - This mode is inspired by the "Gigawing" family of games. Your ship can reflect all bullets around it. This is achieved by keeping the ''special'' button pressed until the gauge becomes empty. The reflector can only be engaged when its gauge is full. You must wait for the "OK" mark.');

It is one of the first arcade-style games ever released for Linux and I''ve always liked playing it. So, I decided to bring it to the handheld masses.  You are the big yellow ball with eyes. You must knock out the other balls that come towards you (Evil Koules fighters). Small blue balls give you extra mass, while small green balls give you extra acceleration. Yellow balls give you tons of both. White balls steal all your power-ups. Gold balls allow you to steal power-ups from other balls. There are 99 levels and as you progress, the game introduces new elements and gets quite a bit harder. I suggest playing on the "HARD" difficulty for maximum fun, once you pick up the basics.  Don''t worry, the game will explain the new elements to you as you move along.  ---------------------------------------------------- CHANGE LOG:  ---------------------------------------------------- v1.0: First release (GCW version): * Adapted from my previous GP2X/Wiz ports: * Added g-sensor/analog stick support * Two-player-on-one-device support * Added music by DST @ nosoapradio.us (Creative Commons 3.0 License) * Added cool randomly-generated plasma background * Adjusted volume of two sound samples that were too loud * Fixed major bug in original game regarding fread()/fwrite() of rc files. * Made HARD difficulty mode the default mode.. MEDIUM difficulty is too slow and easy. * Adjusted NIGHTMARE difficulty mode to actually be playable. * Adjusted HARD difficulty mode so that your player has a bit less mass (hard was also too easy). * Fixed various bugs, especially in menu.c  Pre-v1.0: Initial SVGALIB->SDL conversion also by Dan Silsby (senquack)  ---------------------------------------------------- TIPS: ---------------------------------------------------- Instead of charging at everything you see, try to trick enemies into chasing you and dodge them at the last second.

G-sensor and analog stick control can be enabled from the main menu. If the g-sensor fails to work, that is a bug in the firmware currently being worked on. If you power-off your unit and hold the reset button for 30+ seconds that should get the g-sensor working again.  In two-player mode: two people play on one device, either deathmatch or cooperatively.

As a cinematic platformer, Flashback features gameplay similar to that of 1989''s Prince of Persia. Each level spans a large number of non-scrolling screens, nearly all of which feature multiple levels of altitude �" requiring the player character Conrad to jump, grab onto ledges, climb, use elevators, and drop onto lower levels. Conrad exhibits realistic human running speed and jumping ability, as well as realistic weakness �" he will die if he falls from too great a height.  Conrad also carries a pistol with unlimited ammunition, a force shield (which absorbs a certain number of shots before needing recharging), and a portable force field (which can act as a barrier to deflect enemies'' laser shots).  As Conrad progresses through the game''s seven levels, he is increasingly presented with spatial puzzles, requiring the player to discover how to guide him toward his destination. Late in the game, Conrad receives a teleportation device, and is able to progress by throwing the device into areas that he would otherwise be unable to reach.  Game data:  Flashback is not a free game, to be able to play it with this new engine you need the game data. This port should support all the file formats supported by Cyx''s REminiscence.  * Required data: The DOS PC game data, both the floppy and the CD-ROM versions are supported.  *optional datas: The Amiga mod files can be added to get music during the cinematics. The SegaCD speech file (voice.vce) for in-game speech.  Installation:  REminiscence by default will create a folder for the data and the savefile if it did not exist before. Thus you can either: 1) copy the opk on the GCW0 2) run the opk once 3) copy the datafile in "/usr/local/home/.REminiscence/data" 4) start the opk again and enjoy the game or: 1) copy the opk on the GCW0 2) create the folder and copy the datafile in "/usr/local/home/.REminiscence/data" 3) start the opk again and enjoy the game  Key Mapping:  This port offers two different key mapping layouts:  Type A: Arrow Keys move Conrad A use the current inventory object B talk / use / run / shoot X draw gun Y display the inventory Start display the options  Type B: Arrow Keys move Conrad A draw gun B use the current inventory object X talk / use / run / shoot Y display the inventory Start display the options  you can change the mapping used through the main menu, in the "info" submenu.  Credits:  - Gregory Montoir of course and all the people who helped him with the original REminiscence. - Hi-Ban, who provided great icon to replace the copyright infringing icon I had before. - All GCW0 team for their nice toolchain, their testing done, the GCW0 itself and the nice repo.');

"Roguelike" is a term applied to a wide variety of games which share a common inspiration from the game Rogue. A non-exhaustive list of such games would be: ADOM, Nethack, Crawl, Diablo (I … II), Moria, and Angband. My apologies to the many excellent roguelikes I didn''t list. What characterizes these games? The exact specifications are a matter of debate - indeed, I may receive hate mail for including Diablo - but I shall try to write a few:  Tactical play. The unit of action is based on the individual adventurer. The game is not twitch oriented (like Quake, rewarding reflexes … well trained actions) nor is it strategy oriented (like Civilizations or Warcraft, requiring working on the large picture) Based in Hack and Slash. A roguelike isn''t primarily about plot development or telling a story. It is about killing things and acquiring treasure. Random games. A roguelike is a dungeon crawler where no two games are the same. The maps are different, the items are different, there are no guaranteed win paths. Permadeath. You die, that is it. No restoring a savegame. Good roguelikes delete your save game after loading them. This is compensated by the replayability of the game. Complex interactions of properties. While the commands for a roguelike are simple, the potential interactions are not. My favourite example is equipping a silver ring as a weapon in order to damage a creature vulnerable to silver, but not one''s other weapons. [Editor: This matches the Hack branch of the roguelike tree, not the Angband branch] Steam rolling monsters. If a critter is in your way, and weak, you shouldn''t even notice it is there.');
