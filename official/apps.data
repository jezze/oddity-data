    'Giana''s Return aims to be a worthy unofficial sequel of "The Great Giana Sisters" - an alltime classic Jump''N''Run game made in the late eighties mainly by Armin Gessert, Manfred Trenz and Chris HÃ¼lsbeck, which gained massive attention as "Super Mario" copy, but still had its very own charm and fan base. Story: Evil Swampy and his followers have stolen the magic ruby, which made it once possible for Giana and Maria to return from their dream. Many creatures are after this ruby, but does it really have power, or was it just a coincidence? As this is not bad enough, Swampy fell in love at first sight with Giana''s sister Maria and shamelessly kidnapped her. She simply has been at the wrong place at the wrong time. You take over the role of Giana, get back the magic ruby and most important of all, save your beloved sister Maria and get home save! Good Luck!
